## Benchmarks

This section will contain a number of our benchmarks. To date, we have our own
suite of microbenchmarks, as well as benchmarks on real-world applications. Our
applications include benchmarked data types from the
[Geotrellis](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis) project, and full
benchmarked applications of [Spark](http://spark-project.org/).

Coming soon!!
