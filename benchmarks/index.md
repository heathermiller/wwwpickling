## Benchmarks

- [Collections Benchmark](vector.html) A suite of microbenchmarks pickling immutable collections.
- [GeoTrellis Benchmark](geotrellis.html). Benchmarked data types from the [Geotrellis](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis) project.

<!--
This section will contain a number of our benchmarks. To date, we have our own
suite of microbenchmarks, as well as benchmarks on real-world applications. Our
applications include benchmarked data types from the
[Geotrellis](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis) project, and full
benchmarked applications of [Spark](http://spark-project.org/).

<!-- ### What We Compare Against

We compare against other frameworks which are integrated in some way with Java
or Scala. We do not compare with frameworks which have their own separate
compilers; in these cases, Scala Pickling can be used to *interoperate* with these
frameworks. -->
