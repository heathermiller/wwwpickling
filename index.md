### A simple, legible layout.

Slate is a simple theme with a focus on content legibility and code styles. Use it for your documentation or your personal site to ensure that you're looking good across a range of devices and screen sizes.

Add your content here and get the ball rolling. If you want to generate your automatically page with the Slate theme, checkout [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).

Here's a code example for good measure:

    val lst = List(1, 2, 3)
    lst.map(_ + 1)

<div id="box-wrapper">
  <div id="overview-box">
    this is an overview box!
  </div>

  <div id="benchmarks-box">
    this is a benchmarks box!
  </div>

  <div id="appendix-box">
    this is an appendix box!
  </div>
</div>
